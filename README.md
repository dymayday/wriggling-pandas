# wriggling-pandas

The project aims at improving my skills in game dev just for fun.
The actual game is intended to be played by AI (see https://github.com/dymayday/fluffy-penguin)

# TODO
* [ ] Add a visual indicator when a Panda get shot (a color blinking for example).
* [ ] Add the ability to load previous games from save files.
* [ ] Add the ability to fastforward the game / evolution process.
